# TEXT TO IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS USING STABLE DIFFUSION

## How to Run the Project 

### Step 1: Install Required Packages 

First, you need to install some necessary library packages. Open your Command Prompt or the terminal in your development environment (like Visual Studio Code). Then, run the following command to install all the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers flask flask-cors flask-socketio pillow
```

Simply copy and paste the above command into your terminal and press Enter. This will install all the libraries you'll need for the project.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project 

Create a new folder for your project. Inside this folder, place all your source code files. Make sure you name them correctly, such as `app.py` for your Python script and `index.html` for your HTML file.

### Step 3: Run the Python Script 

Now, it's time to run your Python script. Open the terminal and navigate to your project folder. Then, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
python app.py
```

After running the command, you should see a message indicating that the server is running. It will provide you with a local host URL, which typically looks like this: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Step 4: Access the Web Interface 

Open your web browser and enter the local host URL provided in the previous step. You can simply click the link if your terminal supports it or copy-paste it into your browser's address bar and press Enter.

### Step 5: Use the Website 

You should now see the website interface. Follow the guidance provided on the website to generate images based on the text you input. The process might take a few moments, so please be patient.

### Step 6: View and Save Your Image 

After some processing time, the generated image will appear on the website. You can then view it and, if desired, download it to your computer.
